# SimpleP4VS

This is a Visual Studio 2017/2019 plugin which provides an extremely minimal amount of perforce features.

It exists to let us accomplish the most common actions in a reasonable manner, while not slowing down the editor like other perforce plugins.

Note that this requires you to use a P4CONFIG file to specify the current workspace as documented here:
https://www.perforce.com/manuals/cmdref/Content/CmdRef/P4CONFIG.html
